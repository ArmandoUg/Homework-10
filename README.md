# Homework-10 "Team Profile Enginerator"


## Description
This is the readme file for my Team Profile "Enginerator". This script will provide users an easy way to easily create html page with Employee cards that has simple demographics of the employee as well as contact info and links to some employees github account. This app was created with just javascript that is to be used with node. Node js would prompt users to answer a series of questions that would populate the employee cards. Depending on the employee picked, different questions will be asked. Once the user is done with the prompts, an html page is constructed with a polished ui for the user. The html content is created and appended dynamically via java script.

## Here is a screenshot of a html created after the "Enginerator" is used by a user.
